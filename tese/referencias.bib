abstract="Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) which have been deployed in computer networks to detect a wide variety of attacks are suffering how to manage of a large number of triggered alerts. Thus, reducing false alarms efficiently has become the most important issue in IDS. In this paper, we introduce the semi-supervised learning mechanism to build an alert filter, which will reduce up to 85{\%} false alarms and still keep a high detection rate. In our semi-supervised learning approach, we only need a very small amount of label information. This will save a huge security officer's effort and make the alert filter be more practical for the real systems. Numerical comparison with conventional supervised learning approach with the same small portion labeled data, our method has significantly superior detection rate as well as in the false alarm reduction rate.",

Studying how trends evolve in CS can be interesting from several dimensions. Furthermore, it can be used to craft research agendas. In this paper, we present trend analysis on research area in CS. We also look at citation trend analysis. Our analysis is performed using the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset. We propose the FoS score to measure the level of interest in any particular research area or topic. We apply the FoS score to investigate general publication trends, citation trends, evolution of research areas, and relation between research areas in CS.},

year = {2012},
publisher = {USENIX Association},
address = {USA},
abstract = {Network deployments handle changing application, workload, and policy requirements via the deployment of specialized network appliances or "middleboxes". Today, however, middlebox platforms are expensive and closed systems, with little or no hooks for extensibility. Furthermore, they are acquired from independent vendors and deployed as standalone devices with little cohesiveness in how the ensemble of middleboxes is managed. As network requirements continue to grow in both scale and variety, this bottom-up approach puts middlebox deployments on a trajectory of growing device sprawl with corresponding escalation in capital and management costs.To address this challenge, we present CoMb, a new architecture for middlebox deployments that systematically explores opportunities for consolidation, both at the level of building individual middleboxes and in managing a network of middleboxes. This paper addresses key resource management and implementation challenges that arise in exploiting the benefits of consolidation in middlebox deployments. Using a prototype implementation in Click, we show that CoMb reduces the network provisioning cost 1.8-2.5\texttimes{} and reduces the load imbalance in a network by 2-25\texttimes{}.},
